# Lane-Detection-Open-CV
Using Hough Transform, detecting of the edges on the road and the lane The above code is a Python script for detecting lane lines in a video using computer vision techniques. It reads frames from a video file, applies color filtering, edge detection, and the Hough transform to extract the lane lines, and overlays the detected lines on the original frames. The code uses the OpenCV library for image processing and visualization. The script can be found on GitHub and can be used as a starting point for developing lane detection algorithms or as a learning resource for OpenCV. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible to beginners in computer vision.
